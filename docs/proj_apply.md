# Project Application Recommendations

## Purpose of communicating with mentors

Communication with mentor is a vital link, in which students can obtain the following benefits:

- Answer questions and embrace a comprehensive understanding of open source projects;

- Refine the plan so that students can communicate their solutions with their mentors, and learn from them to improve feasibility;

- Demonstarting good communication skills will also help to improve students'chances of being selected;

## How to Write Project Application

In addition to the detailed technical plan and detailed time plan, students can describe the reasons for choosing the project, past development experiences related to the project technology, courses, etc. in the project application and express their willingness to participate in the project and contribute to the community.

### Technical Solutions

1. In principle, the more detailed the technical program shows, the better understanding and recognition for the community will have;

2. In the technical program, students should show their understanding of the target open source project from the following points:

   - Disassemble the target open source project according to your own understanding and clearly describe the functions of each module;

   - Based on project dismantling, analyze the requirements raised in the project description;

   - Explicitly describe which files in which modules your schema will be modified;

   - Or, which modules will be added to your solution and how they communicate with existing modules;

3. It is best to find a basis for your own project and list it as a reference in the project application, including, but not limited to:

   - Successful experience in other projects;

   - Thesis and other theoretical basis provided;

### Time Planning

1. The granularity of the proposed time plan is not more than one week;

2. To improve the readability of the plan, you can first divide the time into several large phases (for example, four weeks as a phase) and summarize the core tasks of each phase.

3. In each stage, describe the tasks you plan to accomplish in a week in weeks;

## Write something on your resume

1. Resumes are designed to enable the community to have a clear understanding of each applicant's technical capabilities;

2. User IDs of open source platforms such as Github/Gitee/Gitlab;

3. Students should never include irrelevant information in their resumes. Each information should be as relevant as possible to the project they are applying for, including, but not limited to:

   - has contribution to some open source community;

   - Contributed to similar open source software and its community;

   - Experience with open source contributions, although not participating in related community contributions;

   - Not involved in open source, but have experience in developing similar functional software;

   - If you have no experience at all, you should emphasize your mastery of using the technology stack in the community and demonstrate your learning ability.
